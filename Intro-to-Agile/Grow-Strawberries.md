To grow strawberries and get a harvest, we need to complete the next steps: 



1. Choose a strawberry variety
2. Buy seeds
3. Buy a mini greenhouse (seed tray/propagator)
4. Buy potting soil
5. Plant the seeds in the greenhouse for seedlings
6. Cover the greenhouse with a lid to maintain soil moisture
7. Ventilate: every 2 days, remove the lid for 10 minutes
8. Check the soil moisture
9. Water as the soil dries out
10. When the third true leaf appears, transplant the seedlings into separate containers
11. Place the seedlings in a bright, well-lit location or provide supplemental lighting with a lamp
12. When the outdoor temperature is consistently 10 °C or higher, transplant the seedlings into balcony planters
13. Water as the soil dries out
14. Harvest the crop
