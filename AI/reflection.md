1. Identify and share 3 new things you learned from AI in the above task.

   - I can implement Copilot’s suggested solution by clicking the Apply button and confirming the changes.
   - Copilot understands which file I’m working on, so it also understands the context of my question.
   - It doesn’t always propose the optimal or all possible solutions, so it’s important to double-check and ask follow-up questions.

2. Where did you have to tweak or correct Copilot’s suggestions to suit your needs?

   - For example, it generated desktop-first styles, but as we know, about 90% of users access websites via mobile devices. That means the website should use a mobile-first approach, so I corrected that.
   - We can use different Set Modes depending on our needs.

3. How would you explain the difference between using Copilot to generate code for you vs. using it as an effective learning partner?
   To generate code using Copilot means asking it to generate code for me / instead of me.
   To use it as an effective learning partner means asking specific questions to explain and clarify the things I don’t know or am not sure about.

4. Identify 3 risks of relying too much on AI tools when learning at HackYourFuture.
   - Don’t gain the same amount or quality of knowledge I would get by going deep into the topics and documentation myself.
   - Not be able to choose the optimal solution for a task due to a lack of fundamental knowledge.
   - Be excluded from the HYF course.
