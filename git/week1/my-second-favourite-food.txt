Greek Orzo Salad

Ingredients
Vinaigrette:
¼ cup olive oil or vegetable oil
3 tbsp seasoned rice vinegar
1 tbsp red wine vinegar
1 clove of garlic finely minced
Pinch of sugar to taste
Pinch of crushed red pepper flakes to taste
Sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste
Orzo Salad:
1 cup dried orzo pasta cooked per package instructions
1 15 oz can garbanzo beans (chickpeas), drained, rinsed, and skins discarded if possible
1 small English cucumber halved lengthwise and quartered
1 cup of baby tomatoes
½ cup kalamata olives halved
½ cup feta cheese
2 tbsp fresh parsley chopped
2 tbsp fresh basil leaves chopped
Instructions
Make the vinaigrette by combining the oil, seasoned rice vinegar, red wine vinegar, garlic, sugar, crushed red pepper flakes, sea salt, and freshly cracked black pepper, to taste, in a glass jar. Seal with lid, shake well, and set aside to allow flavors time to mingle. Side Note: We like a tangy vinaigrette; if you don't, use less vinegar. 
Cook the orzo in a small pot of well-salted boiling water per package instructions, then drain and rinse with cold water.
Make the salad by placing the cooled orzo in a serving bowl. Add the garbanzo beans (chickpeas), cucumber, tomatoes, kalamata olives, feta cheese, parsley, basil, sea salt, and freshly cracked pepper, to taste.
Drizzle the well-shaken vinaigrette over the pasta salad to taste and toss to coat evenly. Taste and re-season if needed.
Serve and enjoy.
